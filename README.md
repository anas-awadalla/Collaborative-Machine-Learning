Final project for [CSE 453](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse453/21au/)

Distributed machine learning over the internet. Our goal is to let people volunteer their computing power to train a machine learning model over the internet. Users can start contributing right away from their browser.

## Development

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

Then open http://localhost:8080

Listens on port `8080` by default, but can be overriden with an argument: `python app.py 3000`.
